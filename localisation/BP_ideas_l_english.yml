At the beginning of WWII, the plan was expanded and refined to counter the potential invasion of Nazi Germany, which was planned, but never took place.The term "Redoubt" originally refers to a system of fortifications built since the 1880s to protect Central Switzerland as a fortified area for the retreat of the Swiss army. It was a complex of fortifications in the Alps along the lines of "East-West" with the three main fortresses: Saint-Maurice, Saint Gotthard and Sargans. These fortresses primarily defended the Alpine passages between Germany and Italy and did not cover the industrial densely populated interior of Switzerland. Inland areas, in turn, were under the protection of fortifications, "Borderline" and "Army line" — a significant, but non insurmountable. On the contrary, the redoubt complex of structures is designed as completely impregnable, which would not give the aggressor the opportunity to cross the Alps from North to South through mountain passes or railway tunnels. This strategy was to contain any invasion, making it meaningless because of the impossibility of using the Swiss transport infrastructure."
